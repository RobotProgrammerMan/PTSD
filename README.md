# Try to not blow up my code please, that'd be very nice :) - Tyler

# This is the code for our robot :O
# There should be some comments in it that explain what each function does, if not, just ask me, I won't explain it very good.
# This is also the first time I've uploaded something to GitHub, so if it's broken, that's an L + Ratio moment for y'all

# If something is broken, please don't contact me:
